Visual Timetable
================

This is a simple tool to organize your timetable.

## How to use:

Visit the [Class Schedule &amp; Quota Page](https://w5.ab.ust.hk/wcq/cgi-bin/1310/)

Run the following code
`$('<script src=https://ihome.ust.hk/~wcchoi/yatta/vst.js></script>').appendTo('body'); void(0);`
**when you are on the quota page**
by opening the **developer console** of your browser

In **Internet Explorer 10**, press `F12` and then click `console`, and then paste the code into the textbox with prompt `>>`.

In **Google Chrome/Opera 15**, press `Ctrl-Shift-J` and then paste the code there.

In **Firefox**, press `Ctrl-Shift-K` and then in the bottom of `Console` tab paste the code to the textbox there.

For other browsers please go through the menus to see if there is something called `Console`.

When you are done pasting, press `Enter` and a box will show up in the bottom right corner.

You can now add courses to the timetable by clicking the corresponding sections on the course table.

You may close the developer console after that.
